## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
- Jetpack
    - Lifecycle - Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
    - ViewModel - Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
    - ViewBinding -  Feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module.
    - Room Persistence - Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
    - Navigation - Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app.
    - DataStore - Store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally, overcoming some of the drawbacks of SharedPreferences.
    - Paging 3 - The Paging library provides powerful capabilities for loading and displaying paged data from a larger dataset.
- Architecture
    - MVVM Architecture
    - Repository Pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - Construct the REST APIs.
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson/) - Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation.
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Material design components for building ripple animation, and CardView.
- [Sheets](https://github.com/maxkeppeler/sheets) - Sleek dialogs and bottom-sheets for quick use in your app.
- [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) - Provides an alternative to Androidâ€™s MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video both locally and over the Internet.

## Architecture
Cinepolis is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern.
